    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Mack O'Neal M. Charles</h2>
    <h2>Most people call me O'Neal</h2>
    <p>I am Mozambican, born and raised here and I am currently 27 years old.
        I have a 3 years old daughter, whose name is Kalindi and I am married to my beautiful
        wife Laurinda, who has been with me for 8 years now.</p>
        <p>I work as a Graphic Designer, and would love to become Web Developer and Programmer and
        that's why I am getting a Degree in Aplied Technologies with certificates for Web and
        Computer Programming, Web Development and Database here at BYU-Idaho.</p>
        <p>The thing I love the most about BYU-Idaho is that it comes with the Gospel of Jesus
        Christ, we not only study to improve our life professionally, financially but also
        spiritually.</p>
        <p>I like to read and get informed about different things, In my free times like to watch movies
            and listen to loud music.
        </p>
        <p>I believe that the IT sector is the future almost in every field, because technology
        is advancing and everyone is getting access to it, it is meant to make our lives easier.
        <p>In the picture, I am the one in black and that's my daughter on my lap, my wife is
        the one in the white dress.</p>
