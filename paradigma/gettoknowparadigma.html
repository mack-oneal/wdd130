            <h2>Get To Know Paradigma</h2>
            <p>
                Usually, when we are looking to buy a new phone, we have to research about it separately,
                acquire the desired amount of information, analyze it and then decide if we still want to buy it.
                Letâ€™s imagine we had a unique website where we can search the products according to what we want
                from the device.</p>
              <p>As mentioned above, the visitors will have to provide the website with the information on what
                they want a device to do, by selecting buttons and writing this information and then entering to
                get a device suggestion.</p>
              <p>First, the website will contain information about the devices, images, and suggestions to where
                you can buy the products (in the beginning), and eventually we will establish an online store so
                people can get the information and buy the products on our website.</p>  
              <p>The website will contain images, information, links to online stores, links to videos and more.
                The reason why visitors will come to our website instead of going to another one, is the fact that
                this information will already be precisely organized for the them to explore and get the best
                solution to their problem.</p>
