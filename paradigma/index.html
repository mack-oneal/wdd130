            <h2>Paradigma</h2>
            <p>
                The Paradigma website will be a solution to a very common problem with people who don’t
                understand the functionalities and components of technological devices as a whole.</p>
              <p>  The idea with this website, is to provide an easy way to purchase these devices.
                Instead of searching the product first, it might be easier for some people to search what they
                want the product to do, and then getting different optional devices as a result of the search.</p>
              <p>  Some websites allow us to do that already, by selecting categories, but with Paradigma, I will
                provide a more detailed and personalized result with the information you need, sorted as you need.
                This will be a website that can make a life way easier for people who don’t understand a lot about
                technology and can’t keep up-to-date.</p>
                <p>  Our visitors will want to get to know what products would best suit their needs, considering
                  there are a lot of them available in the market and choosing amongst them might not be an easy task.
                  That itself seems to be a good reason for people to visit the website.</p>
