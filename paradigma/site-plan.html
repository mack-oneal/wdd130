      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Paradigma is a website that sells technological  solutions according to
        your specific needs.
        Think about the last online purchase you made. You probably had to research
        about the products to know what they actually do.
        
        So, we offer a very intuitive option to online shopping.
        
        On our website, you can simply: Write what you want a device to do, and we
        will provide you with options, already	selecting the best one for you.</p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Our Audience will be anyone interested in wether buying or understanding technological
        devices. The process of understanding what you're are aquiring is crucial, and unfortunately,
        when it comes to technology, most people don't have the patience to research and properly
        understand the devices they buy.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        The Paradigma website will be a solution to a very common problem with people who don’t
        understand the functionalities and components of technological devices as a whole.</p>
      <p>  The idea with this website, is to provide an easy way to purchase these devices.
        Instead of searching the product first, it might be easier for some people to search what they
        want the product to do, and then getting different optional devices as a result of the search.</p>
      <p>  Some websites allow us to do that already, by selecting categories, but with Paradigma, I will
        provide a more detailed and personalized result with the information you need, sorted as you need.
        This will be a website that can make a life way easier for people who don’t understand a lot about
        technology and can’t keep up-to-date.</p>
        <p>  Our visitors will want to get to know what products would best suit their needs, considering
          there are a lot of them available in the market and choosing amongst them might not be an easy task.
          That itself seems to be a good reason for people to visit the website.</p>

      <h3>Get to know Paradigma</h3>
      <p>
        Usually, when we are looking to buy a new phone, we have to research about it separately,
        acquire the desired amount of information, analyze it and then decide if we still want to buy it.
        Let’s imagine we had a unique website where we can search the products according to what we want
        from the device.</p>
      <p>As mentioned above, the visitors will have to provide the website with the information on what
        they want a device to do, by selecting buttons and writing this information and then entering to
        get a device suggestion.</p>
      <p>First, the website will contain information about the devices, images, and suggestions to where
        you can buy the products (in the beginning), and eventually we will establish an online store so
        people can get the information and buy the products on our website.</p>  
      <p>The website will contain images, information, links to online stores, links to videos and more.
        The reason why visitors will come to our website instead of going to another one, is the fact that
        this information will already be precisely organized for the them to explore and get the best
        solution to their problem.</p>
